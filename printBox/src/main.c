/* This exercise is from Aalto C Programming Basics course
 * Objective: nested loops
 * Write a function printBox(int width, int height) that prints a rectangle filled with character '#'. 
 * You don't have to worry about negative heights and widths. 
 * There should be a newline at the end of each line.
 * printBox(4, 3):
 * ####
 * ####
 * ####
 * 
 * printBox(1, 1):
 * #
 * 
 * printBox(2, 4):
 * ##
 * ##
 * ##
 * ##
